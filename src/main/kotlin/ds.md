## Algorithm
- An algorithm may be defined as a finite sequence of instructions each of which has a clear meaning and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finite length of time.

## Data Structure
- Data Structure deals with the study of methods, techniques and tools to organize or structure data.

## Abstract Data Type (ADT)
- A list of elements is called as a data object, e.g. a list of int.
- The data object which comprise the data structure, and their fundamental operations are known as Abstract Data Type (ADT).
- An ADT is defined as a set of data objects D defined over a domain L and supporting list of operations O.


### Classification
- The data structures are broadly classified as linear and non-linear.

#### Linear
    - Sequential: Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues
    - Linked: Linked Lists, Linked Stacks, Linked Queues

#### Non-Linear
    - Trees
    - Graphs

## Array
- An array is an ADT whose objects are sequences of elements of the same type and the two operations performed on it are store and retrieve.
- Each element of array resides in a memory location  also called a `cell`.

## Stack
- A stack is an ordered list with the restriction that elements are added or deleted from only one end of the list termed `top of stack`.
- The other end of the list which lies `inactive` is termed `bottom of stack`.
- Last In First Out `LIFO`.
- Operations: Push, Pop.
- Stack can be implemented using Array or Linked Lists.
- Push/Pop takes -> O(1).

## Queue
- A queue is a linear list in which all insertions are made at one end of the list known as `rear or tail` of the queue and all deletions are made at the other end known as `front or head` of the queue.
- The insertion operation is also known as `enqueuing`.
- The deletion operation is also known as `dequeuign`.
- First In First Out `FIFO`.
- Queues can be implemented using Arrays or Linked Lists.
- Enqueuing/ Dequequing
